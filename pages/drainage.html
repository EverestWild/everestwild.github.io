            The test went great, probably the best it’s ever gone! People seemed to enjoy the map, but as a result, I
            didn’t get a lot of feedback. Because of that, this update was much smaller compared to my usual changes,
            but I’m taking it as a good thing. I think my map is finally starting to reach the point where the changes
            don’t need to be drastic anymore. The layout is now solid enough that I can start experimenting with smaller
            changes, in order to make gameplay more interesting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Speaking of changes, they’re pretty minimal this time around. Some players were taking advantage of
            high-ground that I never intended to make accessible on top of the team-coloured shacks inside the middle
            building. So I made them inaccessible. On top of touching up the middle point, some players stated that the
            point felt a little crowded, and while I agree, I also like the crowded nature of the point, so I’m hesitant
            to open it up completely. What I opted to do was move the point slightly more towards the back of the
            building, so there’s more space in front of it. I’m leaving it like this for now, but if complaints
            continue, I have plans to open it up more.
        </p>

            One feedback I got was that the flank at the back of the map was sort of unnecessary since there’s already
            so many ways to flank on the other side of the map and I’m inclined to agree with it. I won’t lie though,
            I’m a big fan of the route so I don’t want to completely part ways with it just yet. For now, I closed it
            off in a way that easily lets me open it back up again if I ever want to. I opened the second doorway to the
            ledges in order to give a use to the new closed off flank. I can see the area being a good spot for
            Engineers to set up, however Demoman can launch grenades over the closed off flank into the opposing side,
            so if it becomes too much of a problem, I may need to add something in order to prevent it.

            Speaking of Engineers, during the last test, there was a LOT of Engineer shenanigans going on. Engineers
            were building sentries EVERYWHERE in the middle building and they were really oppressive. I can’t tell if it
            was simply because the opposing team was incompetent, or if it’s a serious problem I should be fixing. It’s
            definitely something I’m going to be examining closely in the next test. I believe the problem may be the
            large ammo pack in the underground flank. If it continues to be an issue, I’ll have to remove it.
        </p>

            With that being said, the map is once again ready for another test. I’m hoping to get some valuable
            information and feedback!

            While the last test helped boost my confidence, this test brought back the crushing truth of reality and
            reminded me that I still have a lot of work to do. The play testers were a lot meaner this time around,
            which was brutal but also necessary if I want to truly improve this map. I think they were so mean because
            they were getting tired of seeing the same issues over and over again. For some reason, I had a huge
            attachment to aspects of the map that were actively ruining the design and instead of dealing with the
            issues head on, I’ve been tip-toeing around them with smaller fixes in hopes that the larger issues will fix
            themselves. Well, this huge attachment has finally been lost and with it comes the most drastic changes I’ve
            made to the map to date!
        </p>
        <p>
            The largest change is probably the entire removal of the upper balcony system that was on the outside of the
            middle building. The original intention of the area was to be a flank to reach the control point at an
            advantageous level, but 75% of gameplay on the map would end up within this area. People were complaining
            about this balcony area every test, and after trying a couple band-aid fixes, I’ve finally decided to remove
            it entirely and focus on making the area below it more interesting. I still like the idea of having an
            advantageous angle on the control point, so I decided to save a small portion of the section and instead
            surround it in a building that is only accessible from the center of the map. This way, players need to have
            already reached the control point before they make the decision of using the route. With the addition of the
            health pack, I’m very interested to see the interactions that will take place in this area in the next test.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            Due to the removal of the balcony, there wasn’t really a point to the lookout towers in the buildings
            outside of the teams’ spawns, so I removed them and took this as an opportunity to rework this area. In fact
            I reworked the entire building, so let’s go over the changes slowly. To start, the ramps going directly to
            the building’s roof have been removed. When I originally added this part of the building, I thought it would
            be a “cool” way to traverse the building, unlike anything done in a map before. However it proved to be far
            too dominant of a route for players leaving spawn, which makes sense in hindsight. Would you rather walk
            through a building? Or straight over it? Honestly, I don’t know why I ever thought it was a good idea to
            begin with.

        </figure>
        <p>
            With its removal, I needed to add a new route through the building to give players more than one option.
            This gave me an opportunity to also slightly rework the interior of the buildings as well. Since there was
            now no way to access the building’s roof, I rotated the stairs and removed the walkway they originally led
            to, which barely got any use to begin with.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            Since the lookout towers are gone, I just extended the roof out to reach the wall. If I’m being honest, I’m
            not entirely sure what to do with this area now, but I’m keeping it for now as I can see it getting used by
            engineers and possibly defensive Snipers, due to the rather lame sightlines.
        </p>
        <figure>

            <figcaption>AFTER</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            I decided to rotate the staircase that goes up to the roof of the main building so now it’s against the wall.
            This was mainly to reduce sightlines, but also having the entrance to the stairs so close to an entrance to
            the middle building might encourage players to use that entrance, which has barely been getting any use in
            the past tests.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="../resources/drainage/a4/Stairs Before.jpg" alt="stairs before" style="width:100%">

            <figcaption>AFTER</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            It was too easy to pass by the control point when using the flank behind the middle building so I removed
            the two upper entrances and added a middle entrance that goes directly to the control point. I also narrowed
            the route so it should be more difficult for players to completely bypass the enemy team and get behind them.
            This leaves the lookouts inside the building with only one entrance, so if these areas become too powerful,
            I may have to re-introduce alternate entrances.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="../resources/drainage/a4/Flank Before.jpg" alt="flank before" style="width:100%">

            <figcaption>AFTER</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            On the subject of the interior of the middle building, not too much has changed, with the removal of the
            outdoor balcony, the segments that entered this building were also removed. As a result, I reduced the size
            of the upper lookouts in an attempt to make them a stronger location for engineers and snipers. As mentioned
            before, if these areas prove to be too powerful, I may have to re-introduce the alternate entrances. I’m
            overall happy with the state of mid right now, and I believe that most players are too, so I’m trying to
            stick with minimal changes for now. One of those minimal changes is that I swapped the ramps going above and
            below the point, so that the one that goes below is easier to see and players feel more encouraged to use it.
            If it continues to see the rare use that it gets now, I may end up removing it entirely.
        </p>

        <p>
            With so many drastic changes, this is the most excited I’ve been for a test in a while. I hope that the
            removal of the large balcony area means that the other routes will see much more use than before. I’m really
            looking forward to seeing what players think of my map now.

            So yeah, I took a somewhat of a break between map uploads here. A large reason for this was that I was
            getting pretty beaten down by the negative feedback, and I felt like there was no way for me to fix the
            issues that the map had. I tried a couple other different mapping projects, but they never really panned out
            and as my classes were getting more demanding, I decided to slow down on the mapping to focus more on my
            personal life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Honestly, what inspired me to continue working on the map was this blog! While working on this, I felt an
            urge to work on the map with some new inspirations. So I got the map tested and the results felt like a
            breath of fresh air. People really liked the map this time around, and while there were still issues and a
            lot to work on, that felt really nice to hear. The big thing that testers told me was that the map was
            really fun to run around in and frag, but nobody wanted to capture the point!
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to remedy this, I needed to better funnel players towards the point. Surprisingly, the back flank
            with the pipe wasn't the problem in this case, like I thought it would be. The flank was honestly used
            perfectly, not used too often, but used enough that it could surprise unsuspecting players. The real root of
            the flow issue was actually on the other side of the map with this giant balcony.
        </p>
        <img src="../resources/drainage/a3/Balcony.jpg" alt="a3 balcony" style="width:100%">
        <p>
            The issue with the balcony is that it’s large and is usually the main area that most players gravitate
            towards after going up the large ramps in front of spawn. From the balcony, all entrances towards the point
            aren’t very eye-catching, so it’s easy for players to walk right past them and go straight towards the
            opponent’s spawn to kill more players. My remedy for this was to take the two flat doorways and combine them
            into one center doorway that is large and protrudes into the balcony. The protrusion has two purposes. One
            is to narrow out the balcony and make it more of a choke-point so that it’s harder for squads of players to
            run across it. Secondly, it’s to draw attention to the doorway, so that people are more likely to head
            towards the point once they see it through the doorway.
        </p>
        <figure>

            <figcaption>AFTER</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Centering the doorway also allowed me to clean up some of the balconies above the capture point. One
            criticism I got on the map was that capturing the point was unfun because you would get attacked from above
            and not know where it’s coming from. With the cleaned up balconies, it should be easier to know where
            attacks are coming from, but I’m going to keep a watchful eye on this area regardless, since I’m still not
            entirely happy with the solution. However, with the new centered doorway, players can now make it onto the
            balcony by using some fancy jumps on the barrels surrounding the point!

        <p>
            This change was more for technical purposes, but I was getting complaints of low frame rates on the map, and
            I believe that it was due to the long sightlines through the fences at spawn. These fences were originally
            placed here because I thought it would be neat to see the enemy’s spawn as soon as the player leaves their
            own, however, this effect doesn’t even work anymore since I moved the spawns, so I replaced it with a
            building to fix the frame rate. Currently, this building is completely solid and is essentially a fancy
            wall, but I may hollow it out and turn it into another entrance to the building it connects to in the
            future. In the last test, an engineer was able to build a sentry nest within the enemy’s building. This
            isn’t inherently a bad thing, but it was so easy for them to do it and I think it’s because most players
            don’t enter their own building because the ramp is a vastly better option. For future versions of the map, I
            may have to rework the ramp and add more entrances to the building.

            Another change that’s more on the technical side, I thickened a lot of the walls, primarily the ones that
            make up the buildings in front of the spawns. I was told that thin walls tend to cause issues, so I changed
            them accordingly. This gave me an opportunity to slightly touch up the buildings, so I did.

            I believe that the map is now ready for another test. I don’t want to make too many drastic changes all at
            once so I’m going to save some of my bigger ideas, such as the already mentioned underground flank rework,
            for another iteration. If the balcony still ends up being too distracting, I am toying with the idea of
            removing it altogether, but we’ll cross that bridge when we get there.

            Unfortunately, the testing for this map didn’t get as many players as I would have liked, so I didn’t get as
            much feedback as last time and as such, the changes are much more minor.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, players enjoyed the map a lot more than last time, but there are still lots of issues to work on.
            For one, sniper sightlines are still an issue, but I just got a lot of complaints and not a lot of feedback
            so I may hold off on large fixes for now. This area, however, is proving to be quite powerful for Snipers,
            so I’ll be monitoring it much more closely in future tests, and may have to remove it or rework it in the
            future.

        <p>
            One prevailing issue is that there are still a lot of issues with flow. Mainly, the balcony area overlooking
            the water pit gets a lot of use, while the back half of the map rarely gets any use. I believe this is due
            to the placement of the spawns, as most players will take the fastest way to the action once leaving spawn,
            which is the ramp that leads to the balcony area. Barely any players even enter the building outside of
            spawn, which have multiple exits and lead to multiple different paths. Thankfully, the fix is quite simple.
            I moved the spawns from the corners and centered them in front of the building so players are more likely to
            use both paths.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another major change I made in order to try and fix flow was adding a path on the outdoor roofs of the
            center building that lead towards the point. This is more of a tentative change to see if it helps with the
            flow problem, but I find that with the way the map currently stands, players that make it onto the roof
            really only have one way to go, so this gives those players more options.

            While the updates this time around are smaller, I’m hoping that the next test gets more players and I can
            get some really good feedback. Current areas that require monitoring will be closely watched in the next
            test and more major changes will most likely be made in the following update. I have some big plans for this
            area in particular...

            This is the first complete map that I’ve ever posted to TF2 and I expected it to be pretty rough around the
            edges, but the players tore it apart even worse than I expected. I’m glad they did though, because it gives
            me a lot of clear areas to improve on, some of which I expected, and others I didn’t.
        </p>
        <p>
            Starting with things I expected, the map has horrible Sniper sightlines, and I already tried to fix as many
            as possible before posting the map! There were a lot of unexpected sightlines that players were able to find
            and take advantage of. The entire balcony area and the area below it was dominated by snipers. This is
            probably because they’re long, straight, strips of land with almost nothing to block off sightlines, even
            when I thought that I did block off sightlines, I didn’t do enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            Starting with the outdoor balcony, I moved the props over and edited their layout a bit in order to cover
            more of the long sightlines, but to also make it easier for players to get up on top of the props if they’d
            like to.

        </figure>
        <p>
            Underneath the balcony, I did the simplest fix I could think of, I straight up put a wall in the center of
            the sightline. This wall has multiple purposes. For one, it blocks sightlines from the other side of the
            map, which makes it less terrifying to go down that path as any class other than Sniper. Secondly, this wall
            encourages players to go around it, leading to either the underground path, or the control point, which has
            its own plethora of issues.

            When I originally designed the map, I was so excited about the area outside of the point that the point was
            kind of designed as an afterthought. I knew it had issues, but the players that tested my map amplified that
            greatly.
        </p>
        <img src="../resources/drainage/a1/Capture Point.jpg" alt="capture point" style="width:100%">
        <p>
            For one, the point was ridiculously small and cramped, a skilled Heavy player or Pyro player could easily
            lock it down and keep it captured for the whole game. This problem was made even worse by my decision to
            leave a ton of health and ammo pickups right beside the point, so the players didn’t even have to retreat if
            they needed heals after a push. This made the point incredibly hard to capture once the enemy team acquired
            it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second major issue with the capture point was that players didn’t really want to capture it. The point
            felt like an afterthought when I created it and that made it feel like an afterthought to players as well.
            The map’s flow didn’t encourage players to actually approach the point, and due to its elevated nature,
            players would end up walking right past it without even realizing that they had missed it!
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to solve both of these issues, I moved the point onto the ground and greatly opened it up, leaving
            smaller spaces for cover to make it more difficult for Heavies and Pyros to completely lock down the point.
            I kept some of the elevated platform, but reworked it to be a control zone to aid in the capture of the
            point, it also makes for a nice Engineer spot. Remember that wall I placed on the area under the outdoor
            balcony? It helps feed players onto the larger point so that it’s much harder to miss! This wall was part of
            a larger decision I made to remove the middle archway of the drainage building, which was largely just to
            force more players through the other archways.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            One issue that I wasn’t anticipating was that players were struggling to find out how to get onto the
            balconies overlooking the point. During the test these balconies rarely got any use and whenever they did,
            the players using them were assumed to be cheating!
        </p>
        <p>
            I thought that the balconies were easy enough to find, but I figured that the issue was stemming from the
            fact that the balconies were pretty much only accessible by most classes through a single path. In order to
            fix this, I added more ways to get up there and extended them to cover the entire perimeter of the building,
            creating a loop that leads to the balcony outside. This made the spot less powerful for players attacking
            the point, and made it easier for players defending the point to contest it. I feared that this may tip the
            balance too much into the defender’s court, so I added some cover for the attackers.
        </p>
        <figure>

        </figure>
        <p>
            This also inspired me to create a flank route on the outside of the building that was originally blocked
            off. As it stood, any classes looking to flank didn’t have a lot of options on this side of the map, so I
            thought I would help them out. I fear this may affect map flow and encourage players to walk right past the
            point again, so I’ll have to carefully monitor it in future tests.
