        <h2 id="ideation"><b>Ideation</b></h2>
        <p>When originally given the prompt of an application that takes sound as an input, my immediate reaction was to
            create some sort of game that uses screaming as an input. Even though screaming isn’t inherently something
            that brings delight, it can be made into something fun and delightful for the users!
        </p>
        <img src="../resources/P1D/Scream Charger.png" alt="Scream Charger Sketch" style="width:60%">
        <p>My original idea was for a game that takes in the user’s scream as an input and then plays an animation that
            dynamically changes based on the length and volume of their scream. As I continued to ideate, I realized
            that this could be turned into something competitive that includes multiple players.
        </p>
        <img src="../resources/P1D/Scream Fight IRL.png" alt="Scream Fight IRL Sketch" style="width:60%">
        <img src="../resources/P1D/Scream Fight.png" alt="Scream Fight Sketch" style="width:60%">
        <p>
            This idea took my original idea, but added a competitive twist to it, making it a game between two friends
            to see who could scream better than the other! The idea seemed like something fun that me and my friends
            would try out. However, as I started planning the implementation, I quickly realized that it would be
            incredibly difficult to program a method to isolate the two screams and have them only affect the character
            they are supposed to be in control of, so a new method would need to be devised.
        </p>
        <img src="../resources/P1D/Scream Fight Turn-Based.png" alt="Scream Fight Turn-Based Sketch" style="width:60%">
        <p>
            This was the natural continuation of my scream fight idea, instead having the two users record their screams
            individually, they would record them one after another and then the application would put them against each
            other. I continued with this idea, but quickly realized that the scream visualization would require good
            artwork with advanced dynamic animations, something that I don’t have the skill to complete, so a different
            scream visualization would be needed.
        </p>
        <img src="../resources/P1D/Scream Competition.png" alt="Scream Competition Sketch" style="width:60%">
        <p>
            This was basically the same premise as the turn-based scream fight, however it would simply use bars as
            visualization for the users’ screams. Once reaching this point in the ideation, I realized that my idea had
            almost entirely come back to my original idea! With that original idea in mind, I realized that instead of
            making a competitive app between two players, I could make something that is competitive between any number
            of players.
        </p>
        <img src="../resources/P1D/Scream Visualizer.png" alt="Scream Visualizer Sketch" style="width:60%">
        <p>
            This application is much simpler of an idea than the earlier ones, but it carries the same sort of idea of a
            competitive screaming app. However it simply has users scream, and then the app gives the scream a score,
            along with a fancy visualization of their scream. The competitive aspect comes with the fact that all users
            can compare their scores between each other and figure out a winner that way. At this point, I was pretty
            finalized with my idea, however the dynamic bar visualizer proved to be a little too much for me to handle,
            so I had to simplify the visualizer aspect.
        </p>
        <img src="../resources/P1D/Scream Scorer.png" alt="Scream Scorer Sketch" style="width:60%">
        <p>
            This is essentially the final idea I ended up going with and implementing. The idea is that the app would
            take in a scream, give it a score, and then hold onto that score if it was a high score. That way, a user
            could set a high score, and then their friends could compete to try and beat it.
        </p>

        <h2 id="randi" style="padding-top: 32px;"><b>Results and Instructions</b></h2>
        <p>
            This is the final product! Once it starts, it will take in screams and score them. The circle in the center
            dynamically changes size and colour in relation to the volume of the input it takes in. The score of the
            current scream, the score of the last scream, and the all-time high score are all stored in the corner and
            can be reset at any time using the reset button below them. The website is designed with mobile devices in
            mind, however it can be used on desktop as well, as shown in the screenshot above.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I think this project does bring delight, as I tested it with family members and friends and they
            had a lot of fun trying it out and trying to beat each others’ high scores. I also did some slight research
            into topics such as scream therapy and found out about the benefits of sometimes screaming your heart out,
            which my app encourages.
